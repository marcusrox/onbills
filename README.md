## Getting Started

This is a Pet Project, I have develop this to learn Flutter, a framework to Mobile Apps created by Google and Dart, a new Language Program, very elegant.

I hope use this project to create a skeleton of application may be used to create other bussiness applications.
To do this, I hove do implement a few of design patterns and lean to integrate with API to bussiness core and others requirements.
